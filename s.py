# E.g., the serverâ€™s friends.

# method for online X - When this command is received by a server, the server should attempt to tell all the other servers it is now online and they should add this port to their list of friends.

# method for offline X - When this command is received by a server, it should tell all the other servers that the server on the defined port has shutdown and remove it from their list of friends.

# method for heartbeat - When a client sends this command to a server, the server should ping all its server friends and return the result to the client.

# method for pass msg X - msg is a text-based message.
# x is the server number we want to send the message to.
# When the client sends a pass command, it should go to the first server. If this server number does not match, it should pass the message on to the next server (one of his friends).
